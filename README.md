# Food-Roulette
Feeling indecisive about dinner? Let Food Roulette decide for you!

If youâ€™ve ever sat there unsure of what to eat, youâ€™re not alone. Thatâ€™s exactly why I built Food Roulette â€” a Python program that turns your indecision into a fun and functional decision-making tool.

It starts by spinning for a cuisine, then picks a matching restaurant nearby. Not quite feeling the first choice? You can always spin again.

To keep things interesting, each round includes a surprise challenge â€” maybe youâ€™ll have to order the most expensive dish, try something completely new, or even pick for someone else.

Your picks are saved automatically, so you can look back on your past food adventures anytime.

Try it out and make choosing your next meal as fun as eating it! Bon appÃ©titðŸ˜‹
